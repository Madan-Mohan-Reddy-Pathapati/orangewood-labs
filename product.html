            <h2> Delivery robot </h2>
            <p> Delivery robots are autonomous machines revolutionizing the way goods are transported from one location to another. 
                Combining advanced robotics and AI technologies, these robots efficiently navigate urban environments, making them ideal for last-mile delivery. 
                Designed to carry packages and parcels of various sizes, they offer a reliable and contactless delivery solution. With their ability to operate 24/7 and adapt to diverse terrains, 
                delivery robots are poised to streamline logistics and enhance the speed and convenience of the delivery process. By reducing human involvement and optimizing routes, 
                these robots pave the way for a more sustainable and efficient future of delivery services.

        <h1 >Features:</h1> 

    <ol>
      <li>        <b >Navigation:</b> The delivery robot can navigate autonomously using a combination of sensors, such as cameras, LIDAR, and ultrasonic sensors, to detect obstacles and map its surroundings. It can safely maneuver through crowded areas, sidewalks, and even indoor spaces.
      </li>
      <li>        <b >Capacity:</b> The robot has a designated cargo area capable of carrying packages, parcels, or other goods. Its payload capacity can vary depending on the specific model, ranging from small packages to larger items.
      </li>
      <li>        <b>Secure Storage:</b> The robot is equipped with a secure storage compartment to keep the delivered items safe during transportation. It may include features like locking mechanisms or temperature control for sensitive goods.
      </li>
      <li>        <b>Real-time Tracking:</b> The delivery robot is integrated with a tracking system that provides real-time updates on the location and status of the package. Customers and delivery personnel can track the progress of deliveries through a mobile app or web interface.
      </li>
      <li>        <b>nteraction and Communication:</b>I The robot may include a user interface or display to communicate with recipients, allowing them to confirm deliveries, provide signatures, or enter access codes for secure deliveries.
      </li>
      <li>        <b>Obstacle Avoidance:</b> The robot employs advanced obstacle avoidance algorithms to detect and avoid obstacles in its path. It can navigate around pedestrians, vehicles, and other objects, ensuring safe and efficient delivery operations.
      </li>
      <li>        <b>Energy Efficiency:</b> Delivery robots are designed to be energy-efficient, utilizing rechargeable batteries that can power the robot for extended periods. Some models may have the ability to autonomously return to a charging station when their battery level is low.</p>
